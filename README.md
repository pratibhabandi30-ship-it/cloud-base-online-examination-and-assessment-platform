## 🚀 Quick start (XAMPP / WAMP / MAMP)

This project was deliberately designed to require **no Composer, no Node, no build step**. If you've got XAMPP running, you can be live in under two minutes.

### 1. Clone into your web root

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aashishbharti04/online-exam-system.git
# Move it into your XAMPP htdocs (Windows example):
mv online-exam-system "/c/xampp/htdocs/online-exam-system"
```

### 2. Configure the database connection

Open [`config/config.php`](config/config.php) and verify the values match your local MySQL:

```php
const DB_HOST = '127.0.0.1';
const DB_PORT = 3306;
const DB_NAME = 'online_exam_system';
const DB_USER = 'root';
const DB_PASS = '';        // XAMPP default
```

> Prefer to keep secrets out of git? Create `config/config.local.php` with your overrides — it's gitignored.

### 3. Run the one-time installer

Start Apache + MySQL in XAMPP, then in your browser:

```
http://localhost/online-exam-system/install.php
```

The installer will:

1. Create the `online_exam_system` database
2. Import all tables + 5 sample quizzes (15 questions)
3. Create your **admin account** with a bcrypt-hashed password
4. Optionally create a demo student (`student@oes.local` / `student@123`)

When you're done, **delete `install.php`** from the server.

### 4. Sign in

- **Student**: <http://localhost/online-exam-system/login.php>
- **Admin**:   <http://localhost/online-exam-system/admin/login.php>

That's it. 🎉

## 🗃️ Database schema

7 normalised tables with proper foreign keys, indexes, and `utf8mb4` charset:

| Table              | Purpose                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `users`            | Students + admins (role-based)                 |
| `quizzes`          | Quiz metadata (title, duration, passing %)     |
| `questions`        | Questions belonging to a quiz                  |
| `options`          | Choices for each question (one correct)        |
| `attempts`         | One row per submitted exam attempt             |
| `attempt_answers`  | Per-question record of what the student picked |
| `feedback`         | User feedback / bug reports                    |

Full DDL lives in [`database/schema.sql`](database/schema.sql).

## 🛡️ Security model

This project deliberately demonstrates a **modern, secure baseline** for PHP web apps:

- **Passwords** stored with `password_hash(PASSWORD_BCRYPT)` and verified with `password_verify`.
- **All SQL** uses **PDO prepared statements** — zero string interpolation into queries.
- **CSRF tokens** on every state-changing form (and verified server-side).
- **Session security**: HttpOnly + SameSite=Lax cookies, regeneration on login, distinct session name.
- **Output escaping**: every dynamic value goes through `htmlspecialchars(..., ENT_QUOTES)` via the `e()` helper.
- **Strict SQL mode** enabled at connection time.
- **Time-taken** is computed server-side (session-tracked) — students can't fake their timer client-side.

## 🧪 Default credentials

After running the installer, you can sign in with whatever you set up. If you accepted the defaults during install:

| Role    | Email               | Password      |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| Admin   | _whatever you chose_ | _whatever you chose_ |
| Student | `student@oes.local` | `student@123` |

> ⚠️ **Change these in any non-local environment.**

## 🛠️ Tech stack

- **Backend**: PHP 8.0+, PDO
- **Database**: MySQL 5.7+ / MariaDB 10.3+
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5.3, Chart.js 4, vanilla JS
- **No build tools required** — Bootstrap and Chart.js are loaded from a CDN

---

## 🧩 Extending it

Some ideas to take this further as a college project:

- 📧 Email-based password reset (PHPMailer + SMTP)
- 🎲 Randomised question order per attempt
- 🖼️ Image-based questions (upload to `uploads/`)
- 🧮 Negative marking / weighted scoring
- 🌐 i18n with `gettext`
- 📤 Bulk import questions from CSV
- 🤝 Per-course / per-department quiz tagging
- 📡 REST API on top of the same DB for a future React/Vue frontend

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**"Database connection failed"**
→ Check `config/config.php` host/user/password match your MySQL setup. Default XAMPP has user `root` with no password.

**"Database unavailable" in production**
→ Set `APP_DEBUG = false` in config to hide the error details (and check `error_log`).

**"Invalid or expired CSRF token"**
→ Your session likely expired. Reload the form. If it persists, check that `session.save_path` is writable.

**Want to reset everything?**
→ In phpMyAdmin: drop the `online_exam_system` database, then re-run `install.php`.
